    will make the homepage. make it responsive later.
    homepage will have 3 sections to choose how the recommendations will be made. one way by selecting a couple of movies. 2nd by genre. 3rd by searching for a movie, a single movie
    the part where you select a couple of movies, the movies will be random.

    starting with code now. will push this to master now and then create a branch for homepage. need to change the readme file before commit.
    created a new branch homepage.
    will create two files: header and homepage
    header done. satisifed for now. will make design and color changes later.

    need to add a background color to whole page. will add it in app.css. and then start working on the homepage file.
    having some problem with the header margin. if I add margin top to the header, it adds the margin to the whole body?
    for now will add the margin-top as 0 and continue with other things.

    adding display flex to the app fixed the issue.

    alright. now will work on the homepage. all the styling, will fix it when I feel like.
