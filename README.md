movie recommendation app
need to have tags for all movies
tag array? how to store the array?
in frontend just display and watched, liked, add to watch later
in backend do all the thing
first make the frontend, then use maybe dotnet backend, research how to host backend
light mode, dark mode
maybe add ml later
make some time everyday for making the db
